# Sportify: Your Personal Sports Companion 🏊‍♂️🏃‍♀️🧗‍♂️

Sportify is a mobile application built with Vite and React, two powerful JavaScript libraries. Our app is all about sports - running, swimming, climbing, and more. It's designed to work in conjunction with our backend, which is hosted in a separate repository. The app is currently available in Persian language.

## What's Sportify all about? 🤔

Sportify is not just an app, it's your personal sports companion. It's designed to help you enjoy your favorite sports and stay fit. In our upcoming updates, we're even introducing a feature that creates a personalized sports plan just for you!

## What's New in Sportify? 🎁

We believe in rewarding our users for their hard work and dedication. So, we've introduced a new feature: if you reach a level higher than 5, we'll send you a gift! Each user can receive one gift. For instance, if you're good at swimming, you might find a pair of pool glasses in your mailbox. Good luck!

## Future Updates 🚀

We're constantly working on improving Sportify and adding new features. Stay tuned for updates that will make your sports experience even more enjoyable!
